This project was inspired by Seorin's F/SN playthroughs over on the Let's Play Archive.
I originally went searching for a text-only version of fate/ to facilitate searching & cross-referencing, but
Seorin's work demonstrated to me that the whole game could be very comfortably enjoyed in a plain-text format.
All I really thought was missing was a dark theme, 
and some way to have music queued up automatically in the background.

A special thanks to the Mirror-Moon team, it has been a joy to read through & reverse-engineer the source code.
Bits of each contributor's personality are scattered throughout, and it has been a truly unique experience to
open up a project that's been meticulously curated by so many passionate people over the years.
None of this would have been possible without relying on their work.

And of course, thanks to Type-Moon, and to Mr. Nasu himself, for creating this universe that we all love so much.
A special form of thanks is deserved here, for allowing the existence of these fan projects; not only for this one,
but for each and every project which paves the way for the next.

So I shall add my name to the list of people who have said these same words over the years:

_Thanks for playing,_

\- Kent Hagerman
